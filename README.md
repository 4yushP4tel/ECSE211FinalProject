# ECSE211 Final Project

## Note:
- python version on the brick : 2.7.13

## Overview:

### Ultrasonic sensor 
- This sensor would be used to ensure that the robot stays on the black line by
making the sensor always face left which would find the distance with the wall,
ensuring that movement is always done along the line.

### Color sensor:
- This would be placed on the right of the robot to be able to sense when the robot
reaches a junction. And until when the robot should be rotating. The color sensor 
will also movable, allowing it to be placed to the front of the robot before
entering a room. Once the sensor is in the front, the robot could move front
until it reaches the room. The necessary checks to enter the room would be made.
Once the robot is in the room, it would be able to sweep the room to check for a 
green square.

### Drop-off system:
- Using a piston system which will push the lowest block out and allow the next
block to fall in position to then be pushed next
